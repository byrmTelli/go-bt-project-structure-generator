<h3>Hello everyone!</h3>
<p>In this project i would like to automate creating boilerplate folder structure for golang web api for lazy developers such as me. You can just improve this and add your default packages and functions depends on your needs. To use this; </p>

```
go install github.com/byrmTelli/go-bt-project-structure-generator@latest
```
```
go-bt-project-structure-generator --name your_project_name
```

<h3>Good luck!</h3>
